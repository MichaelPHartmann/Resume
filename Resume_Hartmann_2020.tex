\normalsize \noindent I am a recent business grad with experience in equity research and investment principles.
I thrive on tackling obstacles and presenting solutions in intuitive ways.
I have a deep knowledge of Microsoft Office and regularily use Excel to model equities.
I have an interest in programming that has started in Python but continues to grow in extent and
in breadth as I look to learn new languages and develop new tools. Beyond finance and programming
I enjoy developing policy, specialty coffee, and helping others understand financial markets.
